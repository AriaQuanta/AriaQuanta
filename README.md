We introduce AriaQuanta, a powerful and flexible tool for designing, simulating, and implementing quantum circuits. This open-source software is designed to make it easy for users of all experience
levels to learn and use quantum computing. The first version includes a compiler for implementing
various quantum circuits and algorithms. Additionally, parametric circuits allow for the implementation of variational quantum algorithms, and various noise models are available for simulating noisy circuits.

**General Architecture**

This architecture includes features such as the ability to integrate various functions, communicate with
external computing systems, manage computing tasks efficiently, and provide a user-friendly interface. In
the general architecture, a quantum circuit or algorithm is first defined, similar to the previous section.
It is then sent to a compiler that integrates a backend and task management and after executing the
program, the results are obtained. It is important to note that the program can be executed using a
CPU, QPU, or HPC. The results include the state vector, density matrix, and probability distribution of
states.

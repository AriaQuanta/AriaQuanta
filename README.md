We introduce AriaQuanta, a powerful and flexible tool for designing, simulating, and implementing quantum circuits. This open-source software is designed to make it easy for users of all experience
levels to learn and use quantum computing. The first version includes a compiler for implementing
various quantum circuits and algorithms. Additionally, parametric circuits allow for the implementation of variational quantum algorithms, and various noise models are available for simulating noisy
circuits.
